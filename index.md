# Women In Python (Shenzhen, China)
## Welcome to the Women in Python community

### Who we are:

The Women in Python Shenzhen was created by Linda Luo who has been in the tech industry for more than 10 years fighting for gender equality. Linda’s goal is to promote the inclusion of women in STEM through Python, which is currently the world's most popular programming language. Dr. Saulo Meirelles joined the project just after its creation in February 2019, as he is not only a Python enthusiast, but he also advocates for gender equality in academia. 

**我们是谁？**

Women In Python是由Linda Luo创立的，她在科技行业从业了10多年，致力于性别平等。 Linda的目标是通过Python促进女性融入STEM，这是目前世界上最流行的编程语言。 Saulo Meirelles博士在2019年2月成立之后加入了该项目，因为他不仅是一名Python爱好者，而且还倡导学术界的性别平等。

Although young, the Women in Python community in Shenzhen is growing fast. The project has been attracting the attention of many people willing to join the group with a common goal: gender equality in STEM. In just few months since its creation, the Women in Python Shenzhen has over 50 participants and due to the high demand we are opening a second class for new participants. 

虽然年轻，但深圳的Women In Python社区发展迅速。该项目吸引了许多愿意加入该组织的人们的共同目标：STEM中的性别平等。自创立以来短短几个月，Women In Python 就有50多名参与者，由于需求量很大，我们正在为新参与者开设第二堂课。

The project has no financial support. The weekly events are held at Trouble Maker (troublemaker.site) that kindly provided a room for the classes. Linda is in charge of managing and promoting the project, while Saulo is responsible for the curriculum and teaching. Other volunteers kindly contribute in different ways so that the spirit of community is growing stronger among us.

该项目没有财政支持。每周活动在Trouble Maker（troublemaker.site）举行，为课程赞助场地。 Linda负责项目的管理和推广，而Saulo负责课程和教学。其他志愿者以不同的方式做出贡献，以便社区精神在我们中间变得更加强大。

### Pain point:

According to UNESCO, the underrepresentation of women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education puts a detrimental brake on progress towards sustainable development. Science, technology and innovation are key to sustainable development, for example: in how we address the impact of climate change, in how we increase food security, improve healthcare, manage limited freshwater resources and protect our biodiversity. Girls and women are of paramount importance in crafting solutions to improve lives and generate inclusive green growth that benefits all. They are the greatest untapped population to become the next generation of STEM professionals – we must invest in their talent.

**痛点：** 

据教科文组织称，女性在科学，技术，工程和数学（STEM）教育中的代表性不足，对可持续发展的进展产生了不利影响。科学，技术和创新是可持续发展的关键，例如：我们如何应对气候变化的影响，如何提高粮食安全，改善医疗保健，管理有限的淡水资源和保护我们的生物多样性。女性和女性在制定解决方案以改善生活和创造有利于所有人的包容性绿色增长方面至关重要。他们是未来最大的未开发人群，成为下一代STEM专业人士 - 我们必须投资他们的才能。



The study of Yang & Gao (2018) explained a phenomenon of “missing women in STEM in China” from achievement motivation and gender socialization. In China, the underrepresentation of women in STEM is due to lower achievement motivation of women than that of men in STEM majors. The authors found there were significantly negative impacts of the lower career expectations from parents and gender stereotypes from culture on women’s achievement motivation. The gender stereotypes from schools greatly promoted male students’ achievement motivation while having no significant impact on female students’ achievement motivation. The traditional gender role attitudes hindered the advance of women in STEM. To prevent this, gender equality needs to be promoted in families, schools and society.

Yang＆Gao（2018）的研究从成就动机和性别社会化中解释了“中国STEM中失踪女性”的现象。在中国，女性在STEM中的代表性不足是由于女性在STEM专业中的成就动机低于男性。作者发现，父母的低职业期望和文化中的性别刻板印象对女性成就动机产生了显着的负面影响。学校的性别刻板印象极大地促进了男生的成就动机，但对女生的成就动机没有显着影响。传统的性别角色态度阻碍了STEM中女性的进步。为了防止这种情况，需要在家庭，学校和社会中促进性别平等。


More recently, AmCham China Women’s Professional Committee and VIVA Women’s Professional Network were thrilled to host the “Women in STEM Professions Panel Discussion” featuring Lily D'Angelo, Global R&D/QA Executive in Food/Beverage and Ingredient Industries; Elisabeth Martin, Vice President of Boeing Research & Technology-China; Ashley Liu, Co-Founder of Mindwalk Studios, an animation and computer graphics company; and Ji Gu, Dean and CEO of Zhen Academy.  


最近，中国美国商会女性专业委员会和VIVA女性专业网络对举办“STEM专业女性专题小组讨论会”感到非常激动，其中包括食品/饮料和成分行业全球研发/质量保证执行官Lily D'Angelo;波音研究与技术中国区副总裁伊丽莎白·马丁; Ashley Liu，动漫和计算机图形公司Mindwalk Studios的联合创始人;和郑学院院长兼首席执行官季谷

The growth of STEM jobs in the future is expected to skyrocket. However, there's a lack of women in these fields meaning fewer female role models, both for current female STEM employees and for girls still forming career choices. There’s no evidence that girls are less capable in these fields, but rather that they often ‘feel’ less capable, partly due to stereotyping. Stats vary by country and by discipline but, generally speaking, women make up only 10-15% of the current STEM workforce, and the gap is widening. 

预计未来STEM工作的增长将会飙升。然而，在这些领域缺乏女性意味着女性榜样较少，无论是对于现有的女性STEM员工还是女性仍然在形成职业选择。没有证据表明女孩在这些领域的能力较差，而是他们经常“觉得”能力较弱，部分原因是陈规定型。统计数据因国家和纪律而异，但一般来说，女性只占目前STEM劳动力的10-15％，差距正在扩大。




### Why/Goal:

Python is the easiest coding language for beginners, and there are lots of libraries you can use. lot s of the robotics projects are using Python. Specifically, eight of the top 10 CS departments (80%), and 27 of the top 39 (69%), teach Python in introductory CS0 or CS1 courses. Python can be used in development of all types of technologies starting from programming a microcontroller to web development to machine learning and data science  and hence it is a great introductory tool to get into advanced topics in computer engineering .



**原因/目标：**
Python对初学者来说是最简单的入门编码语言，你可以使用很多代码库。很多机器人项目都在使用Python。具体来说，前10个CS部门中的8个（80％）和前39个部门中的27个（69％）在CS0或CS1入门课程中教授Python。 Python可用于开发所有类型的技术，从编程微控制器到Web开发再到机器学习和数据科学，因此它是进入计算机工程高级主题的一个很好的入门工具。


Women in Python aims to improving gender equality in technology. We feel like we can reach out to more people, especially minorities in tech (e.g., women) and the less wealthy ones. We are wondering how we go about getting subsidies from the local government and/or companies. This would allow us to grow bigger and, therefore, promote the inclusion of women and other minorities in tech.

Women In Python旨在改善技术中的性别平等。我们觉得我们可以让到更多的人在这个项目中受益，特别是技术上的少数民族（例如女性）和较不富裕的人。我们想知道我们如何获得当地政府和/或公司的补贴。这将使我们能够扩大规模，从而促进妇女和其他少数群体融入科技。
