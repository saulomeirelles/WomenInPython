1:
    - install python
    - create directory
    - create "program.py" file
    - open shell, cd into that directory, run "python program.py"

2:
    - define a function which sums 2 numbers
    - call it and print result on screen

3:
    - same as above but accept numbers as input (from keyboard)
    - what if you type which is not a number?

4:
    - write a file with some numbers in it separated by commas, verify file is created

5:
    - read that file, sum those numbers, print result on screen

6:
    - manually create a "document.txt" file with some text in it
    - print the number of occurrences of a certain word (e.g. "bye") in the text file
    - no matter if upper or lower case

7:
    - same as above but with multiple text files, but only those with ".txt" extension

8:
    - manually write multiple text files with some text in it (lower case)
    - write a program which substitutes text into them, e.g. "bye" becomes "bye"
    - do this by accepting "text-before" and "text-after" from command line

9:
    - write a program which list all files in a directory and prints:
        - file name
        - file size
        - file type (file or directory)
